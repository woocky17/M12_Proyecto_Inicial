## Brief description

In this practice we implement the **CRUD** on the already created entity **Nurse** following this example:

![CRUD](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E12AQEs6G5nlBeiSg/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1700011947400?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ce2K9k-QgyoJZVdpxZJPsDjjex5nG_odjJEp1B0qRSY)

> We are going to use **POST** to create, **GET** to read, **PUT** to update and **DELETE** to delete a nurse.

For the **database management** and object-relational mapping (**ORM**), we are going to use a set of libraries and tools called **Doctrine** that offers multiple benefits like:

> **Database Abstraction**
>> Doctrine provides a layer of abstraction that allows you to interact with the database without writing SQL queries directly.

> **Migrations**
>> Includes a migration system that helps manage changes to the database structure in a controlled manner for keeping the database in sync with the data model as the application changes.

> **Validation and Business Rules**
>> We can define validation and business logic in our entity, ensuring that data is consistent and valid before being persisted to the database.

> **Unit testing**
>> Using Doctrine allows for more effective unit testing, as we can mock database interactions and test our app's logic in isolation.

In summary, implementing a CRUD with Doctrine not only simplifies database management but also improves code quality, facilitates maintenance and allows for better data handling in our app.
